                The Atlanta Area Council is divided into 13 geographical areas called districts. Each district is made up of local Scouting units called Cub Scout Packs, Scouts BSA Troops, Venturing Crews, and Exploring Posts.
                These units are chartered to a local school, religious organization, or community center.
